questions
why can't i set the height of the bartender in the js?
maybe not have a beers div that stores the beers...
how can i set the top and left of the beer to match where
the bartender is even though

intId - counter???




still to do/think about
TO DO :
*make a customer on each row
*fix barteder movement between bars if he has moved left,
*and restrict from moving to the right and left
*detect if customer reached end of bar
*//already in customerMoving and customerStopMoving functions
*need to make more than one beer be sent
*fix the location of the beer creation
//it should be next to the bartender, whatever bar he is at
beersServed - The beers will collide with several customers
the beer cannot dissappear it needs to move right
bartender needs to catch the beer glass when moving left
-(thats when the glass dissappears)

why can't i set the height of the bartender in the js?

*beer is not the right colors, can wait til phase 5
stop pouring by moving to another row
one per row will appear for level 1,
two per row for level 2, levels can wait til phase 5


DO RIGHT NOW
beersServed - The beers will collide with several customers

struggles to mention
// Spacebar will TRIGGER the beer to appear, a small white square
// send the beer and animating it with the space bar is messing me up
// so just take it back to no keydown or keyup events and focus on the collison
// with the customer animation and the sendthebeer animation
// pouring animation seperate mini project
// location of the beers

//day 1 complete
- one beer that fills
- bartender does not move
- one bar row with one collision
- four bars, bartender moves to bars

//day 2 complete
- four bars with four customers that all move together
- beer are being sent, but they are yellow and blank when
the spacebar is held down, have to hold down spacebar
to send the beer

// day 3 complete
TO DO :
Ways to lose a guy:

Customer makes it to the end of the row without getting a beer
Bartender sent too many beers
Bartender does not collect the empty glass
Points:

Add points to events
Add points display

Goal have lives lost when customer reaches the each
get the customers to come in at different intervals

easter egg
insert quarter to start game,
it would be cool to be able to
set the number of lives to more than 3
