questions
why can't i set the height of the bartender in the js?
maybe not have a beers div that stores the beers...
how can i set the top and left of the beer to match where
the bartender is even though

intId - counter???




still to do/think about
TO DO :
*make a customer on each row
*fix barteder movement between bars if he has moved left,
*and restrict from moving to the right and left
*detect if customer reached end of bar
*//already in customerMoving and customerStopMoving functions
*need to make more than one beer be sent
*fix the location of the beer creation
//it should be next to the bartender, whatever bar he is at
beersServed - The beers will collide with several customers
the beer cannot dissappear it needs to move right
bartender needs to catch the beer glass when moving left
-(thats when the glass dissappears)

why can't i set the height of the bartender in the js?

*beer is not the right colors, can wait til phase 5
stop pouring by moving to another row
one per row will appear for level 1,
two per row for level 2, levels can wait til phase 5


DO RIGHT NOW
beersServed - The beers will collide with several customers

struggles to mention
// Spacebar will TRIGGER the beer to appear, a small white square
// send the beer and animating it with the space bar is messing me up
// so just take it back to no keydown or keyup events and focus on the collison
// with the customer animation and the sendthebeer animation
// pouring animation seperate mini project
// location of the beers

//day 1 complete
- one beer that fills
- bartender does not move
- one bar row with one collision
- four bars, bartender moves to bars

//day 2 complete
- four bars with four customers that all move together
- beer are being sent, but they are yellow and blank when
the spacebar is held down, have to hold down spacebar
to send the beer

// day 3 complete
