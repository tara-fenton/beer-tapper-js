## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.

## MVP

Include the full list of features that will be part of your MVP

<!-- Two views: a landing view (1 player button) and a game view -->

PHASE ONE

Game view: One row, one bartender, one customer, one beer

Starting with very basic graphics I will first create the basic functionality and then expand.

* A brown rectangle for the row
* A purple square for bartender
* The customer will be a red square moving to the right
* Spacebar will trigger the beer to appear, a small white square
* The beer will be white for 2 seconds and change to yellow before it will be sent down the row
* The beer will collide with customer
* The customer will change to green and start moving to the left

## POST MVP

Include the full list of features that you are considering for POST MVP

PHASE TWO

Expand the game view: Four rows, one bartender, several customers, several beers
* Create four rows and four taps

The bartender will be able to:
* move through the rows
* loop around from the bottom to the top and from the top to the bottom
* move to the left to catch a beer glass
* jump back to tap by pouring (space bar)
* stop pouring by moving to another row
  Several customers & beers:
* one per row will appear for level 1, two per row for level 2

PHASE THREE 

Ways to lose a guy:
* Customer makes it to the end of the row without getting a beer
* Bartender sent too many beers
* Bartender does not collect the empty glass

Points:
* Add points to events
* Add points display

PHASE FOUR

Landing Page: 
* 1 player button, instructions button

Form:
* Scoreboard initals input - input text field and button
  
CSS:
* CSS transition: Beer fills glass - fired by a DOM event
* Media query for tablet
* Style form, landing page, and game page with class-based CSS.

PHASE FIVE ### optional

Landing Page:
* add 2 player button
  
Game view:
* 2 player logic, 

Bonus round
* see rules below
  
Ways to lose a guy:
* Music is on and customers start dancing and beer was served
  
Points:
* Sometimes there is money on bar for tip

## Game Components

### Landing Page

What will a player see when they start your game?

Intro landing screen with a button for the rules to be displayed on a seperate screen
Buttons for 1 player or 2 players

### Game Initialization

* Can jump back to tap by pouring key (research)
* Can stop pouring by moving to another row

Ways to lose a guy:

* Customer makes it to the end of the row without getting a beer
* Bartender sent too many beers

### Winning The Game

2 players? not sure if the game displays who one the game (research)

### Game Reset

How will the user restart the game once it has been completed.

* Insert Quarter (text on button)

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions. Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility. Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --------- | :------: | :------------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| PHASE 1   |    H     |      7hrs      |      hrs       |     hrs     |
| PHASE 2   |    H     |      7hrs      |      hrs       |     hrs     |
| PHASE 3   |    H     |      5hrs      |      hrs       |     hrs     |
| PHASE 4   |    M     |     12hrs      |      hrs       |     hrs     |
| PHASE 5   |    L     |      9hrs      |      hrs       |     hrs     |

## Helper Functions

Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function   |                    Description                    |
| ---------- | :-----------------------------------------------: |
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string |
